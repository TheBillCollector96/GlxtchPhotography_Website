# GlxtchPhotography - Website

This Repository contains source files for a website designed to promote a photography business online. 
The website consists of 5 pages (Home, Contact, Services, About, and Gallery) to convey the aim and potential of the business as well as their products.
The project was developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, & JavaScripts, and it uses a MySQL Database for operations and record keeping purposes. Furthermore, I used bootstrap as an online CSS library for the styling of the Website. Moreover, the website is responsive and hosted on a free subdomain for preview.
